 I already told you, I did not make this boilerplate, I already downloaded this from someone else which is successful. This means that All we are doing is JUST CHANGING THE UI WITHOUT REMOVING OR CHANGING FUNCTIONALITY so that people cant tell we got it from somewhere else. That is all we are doing, so whenever i tell you  to change up a UI componenet or someething in the boilerplate ALWAYS REMEMBER THIS: NEVER AND DO NOT CHANGE UP THE FUNCTIONALITY OF WHATEVER YOU ARE WORKING WITH UNLIESS I TELL YOU SO. so if something has a link or function i just want you to change the UI of it while still having it remain its functionality. There will be some moments where i May need you to remove or change or add functionality, But I WILL TELL YOU if we are going to do that or not.
